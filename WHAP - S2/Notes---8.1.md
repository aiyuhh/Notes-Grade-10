Shifting Balance of Power
----------------------------------------------------------
- 40-60 million deaths WWII, infra dead, required ppl migration
- Massive Destruction in Europe
  - not even loss distro - E/CEu suffered more
    - USSR, Poland, Germany all lost 10-20% population
  - GB and FR maintained democracy, law, education, innovation = western leading after WWII
    - still tho bc losses ussr/us heg worldwide
- The U.S. - Soviet Rivalry
  - US suffered least of all countries in the wars
    - mainland untouched, got stronk indus and infra bc mil contracts
    - lower loss of life
    - marshall plan - us rich enough to give eu countries financial aid
    - also had atomic weapons - so did USSR - means only two competing at a similar level.
- Advances During the War
  - mil research -> tech dev
    - e.g. air pressure for planes, refrigeration, stronk plywood, plastics. Penicillin too.


The Start of the Cold War
---------------
- tensions made conflict likely but nobody wanted actual way so they did cold war - indirect confrontation.
  - e.g. propoganda, secret operations, arms racing
  - deadliest results are in proxy conflicts - destroyed areas because more intense war because superpower on each side feeding them resources
- hydrogen bomb - dev 1950s research
  - much more powerful than atomic
  - Eisenhower said that MIC/DIB bad too much power.


Breakdown of Empires
----------------
- Br/Fr/Eurs colonized almost all of Afr/Ind/SEA.
- Austria/Turk/Rus = multiethnic with one majority power
- after wwi ppl wanted "self determination" - each country choose its own form of govt.
- Aus-Hung and otto empire collapsed, but ind/chn/afr eu still had power
- WWII - govts focused on hitler so anti-col movements grew - but after wwii
  - a - more mvmts twds self-determination
  - b - GB/Fr/others weakend bc wars
  - cold war meant us/cccp wanted anti-col on its side
  - all means yes anticol happens.
