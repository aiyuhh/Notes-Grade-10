Unit 9 - Globalization after 1900
==========
Understand the Context
---------
- top
  - scientific advances - leads to democracy + international trade
- innovation by Necessity
  - innovation was reactive
  - vaccines + environmentally friendly practices + comms/transp/others.
- Reaction to Globalization
  - free market econ mostly
  - more education and political participation possible bc tech
  - more diversity overall + more hr discussion
  - also - improvement in arts/humanities
    - consumer culture increase
  - UN formed - facilitate international cooperation.


9.1 - Advances in Technology and Exchange
=====================================
- radio - expanded scope of news/music/culture.
- air travel + shipping containers - promotes movement of people and goods
- oil + nuclear power - possible to transport cheaper
- internet - developed by US DoD - becomes tool of communication

Communication and Transportation
-----------------
- Television + Radio - advertised long distance phone calls
- 1990s - cellphones
- social networking sites - made media accessible
- tech revolution was used for good
  - documents US racial injustice in policing
  - helped start the arab spring
  - planes + cargo ship - increase trade


The Green Revolution
--------------
- long-term response to hunger
- scientists developed high-yield grains (rice, wheat, etc.) with resistance to environmental conditions
  - first used crossbreeding
  - started to use genetic engineering
- farmers use more irrigation + fertilizers + pesticides
  - brazil - burn down forests for farmland
- agricultural land space increases worldwide
- small farmers got shafted
  - couldn't afford new solutions, forced to sell land, fewer farm jobs bc automation, heavy chemicals damage the soil, etc.
- genetic engineering looked down upon - negative impact on bees, loss of old seed varieties


Energy Tech
-----------------
- 1900 - coal was 1/2 energy consumed.
- petroleum + natural gas started being used, increased industrial output
- 1930s-1940s - led to nuclear energy, allows easier electric generation
- FF = non-renewable
  - also bad for pollution
- nuclear power - clean but dangerous bc nuclear accidents and nuclear waste
- tech developed to reduce emissions/carbon dioxide existence
- nuclear power begin 1980s
  - 5% global usage
- wind and solar - renewable energy
  - 5% global usage


Medical Innovations
---------------
- antibiotics
  - penicillin developed by Alexander Fleming in 1928 in London
    - first antibiotic - helps cure bacterial infections
  - WWII - saved lives of soldiers - also helps in civilian use when fighting illnesses.
  - Fleming warned about superbugs - extensive use of antibiotics leads to evolved bacteria that are resistant to them.
    - untreatable illnesses
- Reliable Birth Control
  - 1950s - Gregory Pincus developed birth control pill
    - approved 1960s
  - leads to decreased fertility rates
    - fewer children
  - transformed sexual practices, reshaped gender roles
  - 2018 - more than 300M ww using contraception
- Vaccines
  - exists since 1796
  - large-scale development and distribution started after 1900
  - eradicated polio, measles by 1980s
  - can also prevent mumps, tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough
  - prevent more than 3M deaths a year
    - better coverage would save another 1.5M rip
