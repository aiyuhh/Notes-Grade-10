    - multiple groups like Han (largest). Qing dynasty was Manchus. Han and others bc of this thought Qing was illegitimate.
  - famine
    - rapid population growth mid 17-1800s. didn't expand agri enough for stable food supply.
  - low tax revs
    - govt didn't update their tax model for new econ, meant that public infra went to hell. e.g. roads, bridges, irrigation.


- External Challeneges
  - EUR industrialization led to loss in the GlobOrd bc not much CN innovation
  - low EUR/CN trade bc only EURpns could only trade in Canton
    - bought tea, rhubarb, porcelain, silk
    - CN got silver, didn't want their products and looked down on them.
  - growing EUR influence means ppl supported the empress.


- Chinese Republic
  - even tho ppl disliked EURpns they still didn't fully like Qings
  - revolutionary sun yat-sen (chinese format) overthrew
    - believed in confucian principles e..g loyalty/ancestor respect/social harmony.
    - published book called "The Three People's Principles", talked about
        - Democracy - wanted sovereignty forable chinese - expelling capitalists -> egalitarian society.
        - Nationalism - to central authority
        - Livelihood - wanted more egalitarian principles


 - Sun Yat-Sen (Chinese format name) Legacy
   - never got all of China with warlords controlling what he had, gave up position to military leader.
   - led Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) - later got power, ruled China for 2 decades
     - lost civil war to Communists. Nobody ends up implementing Sun's principles.
