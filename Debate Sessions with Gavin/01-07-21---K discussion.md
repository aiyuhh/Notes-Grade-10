Shit to do
---
* ###### update ecocide
* ###### cut some cybernetics cards
* ###### start spreading drills again.

General Stuff
---
#### Bid tournament prep
* for biddies - just make sure you have stuff prepared for ppl with bids, maybe
  cut some case cards for schools in the generally trend of the affs, and you
  should always have prep prioritization.
* once you get to teams that aren't prioritized, have a generic strat or like
  stuff that you don't need to waste prep time for before the 1nc.
* after that - its pretty much just like a local tournament. It shouldn't be too
   different.

K stuff
----
#### general
* turns case and work on the case page like that should always be specific to
  the advantage - as the block is read, it should
  feel like that you have made this block specifically to this aff -
  it should not have any generic turns or any
  implications for the aff that can be interpreted as a generic statement.
* always have stuff like small internal links between the reason why the link
  matters

#### links
* ###### beller
  - keep the broader theory that the card is making - it has the right idea - just like make sure that the card isn't there anymore lmao
* ###### benjamin
  - make more offensive not defensive.

#### impacts
* can add shaw to the 1nc - shorten it tho
* can read the pasquinelli ev in the 2nc if they bring up util. Maybe grove evidence? ecology of war turn. 


#### greenhill aff
* the link ev is wrong - generally, try to use evidence from their solvency.
* try to situate the aff within the link overview - like the mechanism and use
  that within it.
* make sure you have substance within your overview - its necessary for the
  judge to properly understand the k.
