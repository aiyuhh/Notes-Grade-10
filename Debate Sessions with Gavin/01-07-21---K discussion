General Stuff

* for biddies - just make sure you have stuff prepared for ppl with bids, maybe cut some case cards for schools in the generally trend of the affs, and you should always have prep prioritization.
  - once you get to teams that aren't prioritized, have a generic strat or like stuff that you don't need to waste prep time for before the 1nc.
  - after that - its pretty much just like a local tournament. It shouldn't be too different.

K stuff

#### greenhill aff
* the link ev is wrong - generally, try to use evidence from their solvency.
* try to situate the aff within the link overview - like the mechanism and use that within it.
